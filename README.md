# 🚖 Ride Taxi Application

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Ride Taxi Application** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to streamline the process of booking and managing taxi rides. The app offers a seamless user experience for both riders and drivers, from account registration to trip completion. It aims to replicate core functionalities found in classical ride-hailing apps like Uber and Careem, while optimizing for performance and a smooth UI/UX using the GetX state management library.
